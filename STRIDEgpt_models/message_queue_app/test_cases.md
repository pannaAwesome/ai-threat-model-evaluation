### Spoofing Threats

#### Test Case: Spoofing - Message Interception
```gherkin
Given an attacker intercepts messages between the Browser and the Web Application
When the attacker impersonates a legitimate user
And submits malicious messages to the Message Queue
Then the system should detect and reject the malicious messages
And the system should log the spoofing attempt
```

#### Test Case: Spoofing - Message Queue Compromise
```gherkin
Given an attacker compromises the Message Queue
When the attacker injects fraudulent messages
And the Background Worker processes these messages
Then the system should detect and reject the fraudulent messages
And the system should log the spoofing attempt
```

#### Test Case: Spoofing - Background Worker Config Access
```gherkin
Given an attacker gains access to the Background Worker Config
When the attacker uses the stored credentials to impersonate the Background Worker
And queries the Database with malicious intent
Then the system should detect and reject the unauthorized queries
And the system should log the spoofing attempt
```

### Tampering Threats

#### Test Case: Tampering - Message Interception
```gherkin
Given an attacker intercepts messages sent from the Browser to the Web Application
When the attacker modifies the messages before they are placed in the Message Queue
Then the system should detect and reject the altered messages
And the system should log the tampering attempt
```

#### Test Case: Tampering - Message Queue Modification
```gherkin
Given an attacker directly modifies messages in the Message Queue
When the Background Worker processes these messages
Then the system should detect and reject the modified messages
And the system should log the tampering attempt
```

#### Test Case: Tampering - Database Modification
```gherkin
Given an attacker modifies the Database directly
When the Background Worker retrieves and processes the altered data
Then the system should detect and reject the corrupted data
And the system should log the tampering attempt
```

### Repudiation Threats

#### Test Case: Repudiation - Malicious Message Sending
```gherkin
Given a legitimate user sends a malicious message to the Web Application
When the message is placed in the Message Queue without logging or tracking
Then the system should log the message and its origin
And the system should provide an audit trail for accountability
```

#### Test Case: Repudiation - Background Worker Processing
```gherkin
Given the Background Worker processes a malicious message from the Message Queue
When the message is processed without logging the source
Then the system should log the source of the message
And the system should provide an audit trail for accountability
```

#### Test Case: Repudiation - Database Modification
```gherkin
Given an attacker modifies the Database
When the Background Worker processes the altered data without an audit trail
Then the system should log the data modifications
And the system should provide an audit trail for accountability
```

### Information Disclosure Threats

#### Test Case: Information Disclosure - Message Interception
```gherkin
Given an attacker intercepts messages sent from the Browser to the Web Application
When the attacker gains access to sensitive data
Then the system should detect and prevent the unauthorized access
And the system should log the information disclosure attempt
```

#### Test Case: Information Disclosure - Message Queue Access
```gherkin
Given an attacker gains unauthorized access to the Message Queue
When the attacker reads sensitive messages stored within
Then the system should detect and prevent the unauthorized access
And the system should log the information disclosure attempt
```

#### Test Case: Information Disclosure - Database Access
```gherkin
Given an attacker accesses the Database directly
When the attacker reads sensitive data stored within
Then the system should detect and prevent the unauthorized access
And the system should log the information disclosure attempt
```

### Denial of Service Threats

#### Test Case: Denial of Service - Web Application Flooding
```gherkin
Given an attacker floods the Web Application with requests
When the Web Application is overwhelmed
Then the system should detect and mitigate the DoS attack
And the system should log the DoS attempt
```

#### Test Case: Denial of Service - Message Queue Flooding
```gherkin
Given an attacker floods the Message Queue with a large number of messages
When the Background Worker is overwhelmed
Then the system should detect and mitigate the DoS attack
And the system should log the DoS attempt
```

#### Test Case: Denial of Service - Database Attack
```gherkin
Given an attacker performs a Denial of Service attack on the Database
When the Database becomes unavailable for the Background Worker to query
Then the system should detect and mitigate the DoS attack
And the system should log the DoS attempt
```

### Elevation of Privilege Threats

#### Test Case: Elevation of Privilege - Web Application Vulnerability
```gherkin
Given an attacker exploits a vulnerability in the Web Application
When the attacker gains unauthorized access to the Web Application Config
And obtains sensitive credentials
Then the system should detect and prevent the unauthorized access
And the system should log the elevation of privilege attempt
```

#### Test Case: Elevation of Privilege - Background Worker Vulnerability
```gherkin
Given an attacker exploits a vulnerability in the Background Worker
When the attacker gains unauthorized access to the Background Worker Config
And obtains sensitive credentials
Then the system should detect and prevent the unauthorized access
And the system should log the elevation of privilege attempt
```

#### Test Case: Elevation of Privilege - Database Access
```gherkin
Given an attacker gains unauthorized access to the Database
When the attacker escalates privileges to modify or delete sensitive data
Then the system should detect and prevent the unauthorized access
And the system should log the elevation of privilege attempt
```
