## Threat Model

| Threat Type | Scenario | Potential Impact |
|-------------|----------|------------------|
| Spoofing | An attacker impersonates the Web Application to send fraudulent messages to the Message Queue. | Compromised data integrity and potential injection of malicious data into the system. |
| Spoofing | An attacker impersonates the Background Worker to query sensitive data from the Database. | Unauthorized access to confidential information, leading to data breaches. |
| Spoofing | An attacker impersonates the Browser to send malicious requests to the Web Application. | Potential for data corruption, misuse of application features, and unauthorized access to user data. |
| Spoofing | An attacker impersonates the Web Application to access the Web Application Config and steal credentials. | Unauthorized access to sensitive configurations and potential further system exploitation. |
| Tampering | An attacker intercepts and modifies messages in transit between the Browser and the Web Application. | Data integrity compromised, leading to incorrect processing and potential security breaches. |
| Tampering | An attacker modifies messages in the Message Queue before they are processed by the Background Worker. | Corrupted data processing, leading to erroneous outcomes and potential security vulnerabilities. |
| Tampering | An attacker alters the Background Worker Config to use malicious credentials for Database access. | Unauthorized access and manipulation of database records, leading to data breaches. |
| Repudiation | A user denies sending a request to the Web Application, and there is no adequate logging to verify the action. | Difficulty in tracking and resolving disputes, leading to potential misuse of the application. |
| Repudiation | The Background Worker denies performing a specific database query, and there is insufficient logging to trace the action. | Lack of accountability for actions performed by the Background Worker, leading to potential data integrity issues. |
| Repudiation | The Message Queue denies receiving a message from the Web Application, and there is no logging to verify the message flow. | Difficulty in tracing the flow of messages, leading to potential data loss and integrity issues. |
| Information Disclosure | An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Web Application Config and retrieves sensitive credentials. | Exposure of sensitive information, leading to potential further exploitation of the system. |
| Information Disclosure | An attacker intercepts messages in transit between the Web Application and the Message Queue. | Exposure of confidential data, leading to potential data breaches and loss of trust. |
| Information Disclosure | An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Background Worker Config and retrieves sensitive credentials. | Exposure of database access credentials, leading to potential data breaches. |
| Information Disclosure | An attacker intercepts queries sent from the Background Worker to the Database. | Exposure of sensitive database queries and data, leading to potential data breaches. |
| Denial of Service | An attacker floods the Web Application with a high volume of requests, causing it to become unresponsive. | Service disruption, leading to downtime and potential financial loss. |
| Denial of Service | An attacker floods the Message Queue with a large number of messages, causing it to become unresponsive. | Service disruption, leading to delays in message processing and potential system failures. |
| Denial of Service | An attacker floods the Database with a high volume of queries, causing it to become unresponsive. | Service disruption, leading to delays in data retrieval and potential system failures. |
| Denial of Service | An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the Background Worker to crash it, causing service interruptions. | Service disruption, leading to delays in background processing and potential system failures. |
| Elevation of Privilege | An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the Web Application to gain higher privileges and access sensitive data. | Unauthorized access to sensitive information, leading to potential data breaches. |
| Elevation of Privilege | An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the Background Worker to gain higher privileges and access the Database. | Unauthorized access to database records, leading to potential data breaches. |
| Elevation of Privilege | An attacker compromises the Message Queue to gain higher privileges and intercept messages. | Unauthorized access to message data, leading to potential data breaches. |
| Elevation of Privilege | An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the Web Application to gain higher privileges and access the Web Application Config. | Unauthorized access to sensitive configurations, leading to potential further exploitation. |


## Improvement Suggestions

- Please provide more details about the authentication flow between components to better analyze potential authentication bypass scenarios.
- Consider adding information about how sensitive data is stored and transmitted to enable more precise data exposure threat analysis.
- Clarify the technical stack and libraries used in the Web Application and Background Worker to identify potential vulnerabilities.
- Provide more details on the data flow between the Browser, Web Application, Message Queue, and Database to identify specific data tampering and interception threats.
- Describe the system boundaries and trust zones to better understand the potential attack surfaces.
- Elaborate on the logging and monitoring mechanisms in place to assess the risk of repudiation threats.
