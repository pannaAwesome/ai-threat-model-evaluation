## Threat Model

| Threat Type | Scenario | Potential Impact |
|-------------|----------|------------------|
| Spoofing | An attacker intercepts messages between the Browser and the Web Application, impersonating a legitimate user to submit malicious messages to the Message Queue. | Unauthorized access and injection of harmful messages into the system. |
| Spoofing | An attacker compromises the Message Queue and injects fraudulent messages, which are then processed by the Background Worker as legitimate requests. | Compromised data integrity and potential execution of unauthorized commands. |
| Spoofing | An attacker gains access to the Background Worker Config and uses the stored credentials to impersonate the Background Worker, querying the Database with malicious intent. | Unauthorized data access and potential data corruption. |
| Tampering | An attacker intercepts and modifies messages sent from the Browser to the Web Application before they are placed in the Message Queue. | Altered data processing and potential execution of unintended actions. |
| Tampering | An attacker directly modifies messages in the Message Queue before they are processed by the Background Worker. | Compromised data integrity and execution of malicious commands. |
| Tampering | An attacker modifies the Database directly, altering the data that the Background Worker retrieves and processes. | Corrupted data and potential system malfunction. |
| Repudiation | A legitimate user sends a malicious message to the Web Application, which then places it in the Message Queue, without any logging or tracking. | Difficulty in tracing and holding the user accountable for the malicious actions. |
| Repudiation | The Background Worker processes a malicious message from the Message Queue without logging the source, making it hard to identify the origin of the malicious request. | Inability to trace back and identify the source of malicious activities. |
| Repudiation | An attacker modifies the Database, and the Background Worker processes the altered data without any audit trail. | Lack of accountability for data tampering incidents. |
| Information Disclosure | An attacker intercepts messages sent from the Browser to the Web Application, gaining access to sensitive data. | Exposure of sensitive information leading to potential data breaches. |
| Information Disclosure | An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Message Queue and reads sensitive messages stored within. | Compromise of sensitive data and potential misuse. |
| Information Disclosure | An attacker accesses the Database directly and reads sensitive data stored within. | Exposure of sensitive information and potential data breaches. |
| Denial of Service | An attacker floods the Web Application with requests, overwhelming it and preventing legitimate users from accessing the service. | Service disruption and unavailability for legitimate users. |
| Denial of Service | An attacker floods the Message Queue with a large number of messages, overwhelming the Background Worker and causing processing delays. | Service disruption and delayed processing of legitimate messages. |
| Denial of Service | An attacker performs a Denial of Service attack on the Database, making it unavailable for the Background Worker to query. | Service disruption and inability to process messages that require database access. |
| Elevation of Privilege | An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the Web Application to gain unauthorized access to the Web Application Config, obtaining sensitive credentials. | Elevated privileges and potential unauthorized access to the Message Queue. |
| Elevation of Privilege | An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the Background Worker to gain unauthorized access to the Background Worker Config, obtaining sensitive credentials. | Elevated privileges and potential unauthorized access to the Database. |
| Elevation of Privilege | An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Database and escalates privileges to modify or delete sensitive data. | Compromised data integrity and potential data loss. |


## Improvement Suggestions

- Please provide more details about the authentication flow between components to better analyze potential authentication bypass scenarios.
- Consider adding information about how sensitive data is stored and transmitted to enable more precise data exposure threat analysis.
- Describe the specific technologies and frameworks used in the Web Application and Background Worker to identify technology-specific vulnerabilities.
- Explain the data flow and interaction between the Browser, Web Application, Message Queue, and Background Worker to better understand potential points of interception and tampering.
- Clarify the system boundaries and trust zones, particularly how the Web Application and Background Worker communicate with external entities and untrusted data stores.
- Provide details on logging and monitoring mechanisms in place to better assess potential repudiation threats and improve accountability.
