## Threat Model

| Threat Type | Scenario | Potential Impact |
|-------------|----------|------------------|
| Spoofing | An attacker impersonates a legitimate user by guessing or brute-forcing the username and password, gaining unauthorized access to the Web UI. | Unauthorized access to customer data, including personally identifiable information. |
| Spoofing | An attacker intercepts the session ID transmitted between the client and the Web Service and uses it to impersonate a legitimate user. | Unauthorized access to customer data processed by the Web Service. |
| Spoofing | An attacker sends crafted XML input to the Web Service, exploiting vulnerabilities in the XML parser to impersonate a legitimate user or service. | Unauthorized access to customer data processed by the Web Service. |
| Tampering | An attacker intercepts and modifies the data transmitted between the Web UI and the Web Service, altering customer data. | Data integrity compromise, leading to incorrect processing and potential data loss. |
| Tampering | An attacker intercepts and modifies the data transmitted between the Web Service and PostgreSQL, altering the stored customer data. | Data integrity compromise, leading to incorrect data retrieval and potential data loss. |
| Tampering | An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the Web Service to tamper with the session management, leading to session hijacking. | Unauthorized access to customer data and potential data manipulation. |
| Repudiation | A user performs unauthorized actions and then denies having performed them, as there is no logging mechanism to track user actions. | Difficulty in tracing unauthorized activities and holding users accountable. |
| Repudiation | An attacker performs actions using a legitimate user's credentials and denies involvement, as there is no audit trail to prove the actions. | Difficulty in tracing unauthorized activities and holding attackers accountable. |
| Repudiation | A user denies receiving or sending specific data, as there is no mechanism to verify the data exchange. | Difficulty in resolving disputes related to data exchange. |
| Information Disclosure | An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the Web Service to access sensitive customer data stored in PostgreSQL. | Exposure of sensitive customer data, including personally identifiable information. |
| Information Disclosure | An attacker intercepts the data transmitted between the Web UI and the Web Service, gaining access to sensitive customer data. | Exposure of sensitive customer data, including personally identifiable information. |
| Information Disclosure | An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the Web UI to access sensitive customer data processed by the Web Service. | Exposure of sensitive customer data, including personally identifiable information. |
| Denial of Service | An attacker floods the Web Service with a large number of requests, causing it to become unresponsive. | Service disruption, leading to unavailability of the application for legitimate users. |
| Denial of Service | An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the Web Service to consume excessive resources, causing it to become unresponsive. | Service disruption, leading to unavailability of the application for legitimate users. |
| Denial of Service | An attacker floods the Web UI with a large number of requests, causing it to become unresponsive. | Service disruption, leading to unavailability of the application for legitimate users. |
| Elevation of Privilege | An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the Web Service to gain administrative access, allowing them to perform unauthorized actions. | Unauthorized access to administrative functions, leading to potential data manipulation and service disruption. |
| Elevation of Privilege | An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the Web UI to gain administrative access, allowing them to perform unauthorized actions. | Unauthorized access to administrative functions, leading to potential data manipulation and service disruption. |
| Elevation of Privilege | An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the session management of the Web Service to gain elevated privileges. | Unauthorized access to administrative functions, leading to potential data manipulation and service disruption. |


## Improvement Suggestions

- Please provide more details about the authentication flow between components to better analyze potential authentication bypass scenarios.
- Consider adding information about how sensitive data is stored and transmitted to enable more precise data exposure threat analysis.
- Describe the specific mechanisms used for session management and how session IDs are protected from interception.
- Provide more details on the logging and auditing mechanisms in place to track user actions and data exchanges.
- Include information about any rate limiting or DDoS protection mechanisms in place to better assess denial of service threats.
- Specify the technical stack and libraries used in the Web UI and Web Service to identify potential vulnerabilities in third-party components.
- Clarify the system boundaries and trust zones, especially how data flows between the Web UI, Web Service, and PostgreSQL are secured.
- Detail the encryption mechanisms and key management practices for data at rest and in transit.
- Explain how the Web Service processes and validates XML input to identify potential XML-based threats.
