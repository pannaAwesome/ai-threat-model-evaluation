| Threat Type | Scenario | Suggested Mitigation(s) |
|-------------|----------|------------------------|
| Spoofing | An attacker impersonates a legitimate user by guessing or brute-forcing the username and password, gaining unauthorized access to the Web UI. | Implement strong password policies. <br> Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA). <br> Use account lockout policies after multiple failed login attempts. <br> Implement CAPTCHA to prevent automated guessing. |
| Spoofing | An attacker intercepts the session ID transmitted between the client and the Web Service and uses it to impersonate a legitimate user. | Use secure, HTTP-only cookies for session management. <br> Implement short session timeouts and re-authentication for sensitive actions. <br> Use SSL/TLS to encrypt data in transit. <br> Regenerate session IDs after successful login. |
| Spoofing | An attacker sends crafted XML input to the Web Service, exploiting vulnerabilities in the XML parser to impersonate a legitimate user or service. | Implement strict input validation and sanitization. <br> Use secure XML parsers that are not vulnerable to attacks like XML External Entities (XXE). <br> Implement Web Application Firewalls (WAF) to detect and block malicious input. |
| Tampering | An attacker intercepts and modifies the data transmitted between the Web UI and the Web Service, altering customer data. | Use SSL/TLS to encrypt data in transit. <br> Implement hash-based message authentication codes (HMAC) to ensure data integrity. <br> Use digital signatures to verify the authenticity of the data. |
| Tampering | An attacker intercepts and modifies the data transmitted between the Web Service and PostgreSQL, altering the stored customer data. | Use SSL/TLS to encrypt data in transit. <br> Implement database-level encryption. <br> Use prepared statements and parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection. |
| Tampering | An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the Web Service to tamper with the session management, leading to session hijacking. | Implement secure session management practices. <br> Use short session timeouts and re-authentication for sensitive actions. <br> Regenerate session IDs after successful login and logout. |
| Repudiation | A user performs unauthorized actions and then denies having performed them, as there is no logging mechanism to track user actions. | Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring. <br> Use audit trails to track user actions. <br> Ensure logs are securely stored and tamper-evident. |
| Repudiation | An attacker performs actions using a legitimate user's credentials and denies involvement, as there is no audit trail to prove the actions. | Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA). <br> Use audit trails to track user actions. <br> Ensure logs are securely stored and tamper-evident. |
| Repudiation | A user denies receiving or sending specific data, as there is no mechanism to verify the data exchange. | Implement digital signatures and timestamps for data exchange. <br> Use non-repudiation protocols to ensure data exchange is verifiable. <br> Maintain detailed logs of data exchange transactions. |
