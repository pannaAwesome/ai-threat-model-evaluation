### Spoofing Threats

#### Test Case: Spoofing via Guessing or Brute-Forcing Credentials
```gherkin
Given an attacker impersonates a legitimate user by guessing or brute-forcing the username and password
When the attacker attempts to access the Web UI
Then the system should detect and block multiple failed login attempts
And the system should notify the legitimate user of the unauthorized access attempt
```

#### Test Case: Spoofing via Session ID Interception
```gherkin
Given an attacker intercepts the session ID transmitted between the client and the Web Service
When the attacker uses the intercepted session ID to impersonate a legitimate user
Then the system should detect the session ID reuse
And the system should invalidate the compromised session ID
```

#### Test Case: Spoofing via Crafted XML Input
```gherkin
Given an attacker sends crafted XML input to the Web Service
When the attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the XML parser to impersonate a legitimate user or service
Then the system should validate and sanitize the XML input
And the system should reject malformed or malicious XML input
```

### Tampering Threats

#### Test Case: Tampering with Data Transmitted Between Web UI and Web Service
```gherkin
Given an attacker intercepts and modifies the data transmitted between the Web UI and the Web Service
When the attacker alters customer data
Then the system should detect data integrity violations
And the system should reject the tampered data
```

#### Test Case: Tampering with Data Transmitted Between Web Service and PostgreSQL
```gherkin
Given an attacker intercepts and modifies the data transmitted between the Web Service and PostgreSQL
When the attacker alters the stored customer data
Then the system should detect data integrity violations
And the system should reject the tampered data
```

#### Test Case: Tampering with Session Management
```gherkin
Given an attacker exploits a vulnerability in the Web Service to tamper with the session management
When the attacker attempts to hijack a session
Then the system should detect and prevent session hijacking
And the system should invalidate the compromised session
```

### Repudiation Threats

#### Test Case: Repudiation of Unauthorized Actions
```gherkin
Given a user performs unauthorized actions
When the user denies having performed them
Then the system should log all user actions
And the system should provide an audit trail to trace unauthorized activities
```

#### Test Case: Repudiation of Actions Using Legitimate Credentials
```gherkin
Given an attacker performs actions using a legitimate user's credentials
When the attacker denies involvement
Then the system should log all actions performed using the credentials
And the system should provide an audit trail to trace unauthorized activities
```

#### Test Case: Repudiation of Data Exchange
```gherkin
Given a user denies receiving or sending specific data
When the user disputes the data exchange
Then the system should log all data exchange transactions
And the system should provide a mechanism to verify the data exchange
```

### Information Disclosure Threats

#### Test Case: Information Disclosure via Web Service Vulnerability
```gherkin
Given an attacker exploits a vulnerability in the Web Service
When the attacker attempts to access sensitive customer data stored in PostgreSQL
Then the system should detect and prevent unauthorized access
And the system should log the unauthorized access attempt
```

#### Test Case: Information Disclosure via Data Interception
```gherkin
Given an attacker intercepts the data transmitted between the Web UI and the Web Service
When the attacker attempts to gain access to sensitive customer data
Then the system should encrypt the data transmission
And the system should detect and prevent unauthorized access
```

#### Test Case: Information Disclosure via Web UI Vulnerability
```gherkin
Given an attacker exploits a vulnerability in the Web UI
When the attacker attempts to access sensitive customer data processed by the Web Service
Then the system should detect and prevent unauthorized access
And the system should log the unauthorized access attempt
```

### Denial of Service Threats

#### Test Case: Denial of Service via Request Flooding (Web Service)
```gherkin
Given an attacker floods the Web Service with a large number of requests
When the Web Service becomes unresponsive
Then the system should detect and mitigate the request flooding
And the system should maintain availability for legitimate users
```

#### Test Case: Denial of Service via Resource Consumption (Web Service)
```gherkin
Given an attacker exploits a vulnerability in the Web Service to consume excessive resources
When the Web Service becomes unresponsive
Then the system should detect and mitigate excessive resource consumption
And the system should maintain availability for legitimate users
```

#### Test Case: Denial of Service via Request Flooding (Web UI)
```gherkin
Given an attacker floods the Web UI with a large number of requests
When the Web UI becomes unresponsive
Then the system should detect and mitigate the request flooding
And the system should maintain availability for legitimate users
```

### Elevation of Privilege Threats

#### Test Case: Elevation of Privilege via Web Service Vulnerability
```gherkin
Given an attacker exploits a vulnerability in the Web Service
When the attacker gains administrative access
Then the system should detect and prevent unauthorized access
And the system should log the unauthorized access attempt
```

#### Test Case: Elevation of Privilege via Web UI Vulnerability
```gherkin
Given an attacker exploits a vulnerability in the Web UI
When the attacker gains administrative access
Then the system should detect and prevent unauthorized access
And the system should log the unauthorized access attempt
```

#### Test Case: Elevation of Privilege via Session Management Vulnerability
```gherkin
Given an attacker exploits a vulnerability in the session management of the Web Service
When the attacker gains elevated privileges
Then the system should detect and prevent unauthorized access
And the system should log the unauthorized access attempt
```
