## Improvement Suggestions

| Threat Type         | Scenario | Suggested Mitigation(s) |
|--------------------|----------|--------------------------|
| **Spoofing**       | An attacker could spoof the Browser's identity to gain access to the IoT Edge device over the same network, as Basic Authentication is being used. | Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) and use stronger authentication mechanisms such as OAuth or certificate-based authentication. Ensure secure communication channels using TLS/SSL. |
| **Spoofing**       | An attacker impersonates the IoT Edge Device to send malicious data to Azure services by intercepting and modifying network traffic. | Use mutual TLS (mTLS) for secure communication between the IoT Edge Device and Azure services. Implement message signing and verification to ensure data integrity. |
| **Spoofing**       | An attacker spoofs the identity of M1 to interact with M2 and M3, leading to unauthorized access to internal communications. | Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms between M1, M2, and M3. Use digital signatures and encryption to protect internal communications. |
| **Tampering**      | An attacker intercepts and modifies the data sent from M3 to the Azure Cognitive Service, altering OCR and Text-to-Speech information. | Use end-to-end encryption and message authentication codes (MACs) to ensure data integrity and authenticity. Implement secure data transmission protocols. |
| **Tampering**      | An attacker modifies the telemetry information sent from the IoT Edge Device to Azure Application Insights. | Use secure data transmission protocols and implement data integrity checks, such as checksums or digital signatures. Ensure that telemetry data is encrypted in transit. |
| **Tampering**      | An attacker tampers with the connection strings stored in GitHub secrets, leading to unauthorized access to Azure services. | Use secure secrets management practices, such as Azure Key Vault, to store and manage connection strings. Implement access controls and auditing for secrets management. |
| **Repudiation**    | An attacker performs malicious actions and denies their involvement due to the lack of robust logging and auditing mechanisms. | Implement comprehensive logging and auditing mechanisms to track all actions and changes. Use centralized logging solutions and ensure logs are tamper-proof. |
| **Repudiation**    | An attacker manipulates the telemetry data sent to Azure Application Insights, making it difficult to trace back the source of data manipulation. | Implement robust data integrity checks and use digital signatures to ensure the authenticity of telemetry data. Use centralized logging and auditing to track data changes. |
| **Repudiation**    | An attacker denies performing unauthorized actions on the IoT Edge Device due to weak logging mechanisms on the device. | Enhance logging mechanisms on the IoT Edge Device to capture all relevant actions and changes. Use centralized logging and ensure logs are securely stored and tamper-proof. |
| **Information Disclosure** | An attacker intercepts the connection strings used by Azure services, leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data. | Use secure communication channels and encrypt connection strings in transit and at rest. Implement strong access controls and use secure secrets management practices. |
| **Information Disclosure** | An attacker accesses the video frames processed by M1, M2, and M3, leading to unauthorized access to sensitive video data. | Implement end-to-end encryption for video data transmission and storage. Use access controls and authentication mechanisms to restrict access to video data. |
| **Information Disclosure** | An attacker intercepts the telemetry data sent to Azure Application Insights, leading to unauthorized access to operational data. | Use secure data transmission protocols and encrypt telemetry data in transit. Implement access controls and authentication mechanisms to protect operational data. |
| **Denial of Service** | An attacker floods the HTTP endpoints of M1, M2, and M3 with excessive requests, leading to a denial of service. | Implement rate limiting and throttling mechanisms to control the number of requests. Use load balancers and distribute traffic to prevent overloading. |
| **Denial of Service** | An attacker floods the Azure Cognitive Service with excessive requests, leading to a denial of service. | Implement rate limiting and throttling mechanisms to control the number of requests. Use auto-scaling and load balancing to handle increased traffic. |
| **Denial of Service** | An attacker floods the Azure Storage with excessive upload requests, leading to a denial of service. | Implement rate limiting and throttling mechanisms to control the number of upload requests. Use auto-scaling and load balancing to handle increased traffic. |
| **Elevation of Privilege** | An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the IoT Edge Device to gain elevated privileges, leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data and control over the device. | Implement the principle of least privilege and use role-based access control (RBAC). Regularly update and patch the IoT Edge Device to address vulnerabilities. |
| **Elevation of Privilege** | An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the Azure services to gain elevated privileges, leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data and control over the services. | Implement the principle of least privilege and use role-based access control (RBAC). Regularly update and patch Azure services to address vulnerabilities. |
| **Elevation of Privilege** | An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the Browser to gain elevated privileges, leading to unauthorized access to the IoT Edge Device. | Implement the principle of least privilege and use role-based access control (RBAC). Regularly update and patch the Browser to address vulnerabilities. |
