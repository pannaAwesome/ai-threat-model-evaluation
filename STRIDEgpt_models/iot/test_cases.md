When the attacker attempts to access Azure services using tampered connection strings
Then the system should detect and block the unauthorized access
And the system should log the attempt to use tampered connection strings
```

### Test Case 7: Repudiation - Lack of Logging
```gherkin
Given an attacker performs malicious actions and denies their involvement due to the lack of robust logging and auditing mechanisms
When the attacker performs malicious actions
Then the system should log all actions with detailed audit trails
And the system should be able to trace back the actions to the attacker
```

### Test Case 8: Repudiation - Telemetry Data Manipulation
```gherkin
Given an attacker manipulates the telemetry data sent to Azure Application Insights, making it difficult to trace back the source of data manipulation
When the attacker manipulates the telemetry data
Then the system should detect and log the manipulation attempt
And the system should be able to trace back the source of data manipulation
```

### Test Case 9: Repudiation - Weak Logging on IoT Edge Device
```gherkin
Given an attacker denies performing unauthorized actions on the IoT Edge Device due to weak logging mechanisms on the device
When the attacker performs unauthorized actions on the IoT Edge Device
Then the system should log all actions with detailed audit trails
And the system should be able to trace back the unauthorized actions to the attacker
```

### Test Case 10: Information Disclosure - Connection Strings
```gherkin
Given an attacker intercepts the connection strings used by Azure services, leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data
When the attacker attempts to access Azure services using intercepted connection strings
Then the system should detect and block the unauthorized access
And the system should log the attempt to use intercepted connection strings
```

### Test Case 11: Information Disclosure - Video Frames
```gherkin
Given an attacker accesses the video frames processed by M1, M2, and M3, leading to unauthorized access to sensitive video data
When the attacker attempts to access the video frames
Then the system should detect and block the unauthorized access
And the system should log the attempt to access the video frames
```

### Test Case 12: Information Disclosure - Telemetry Data
```gherkin
Given an attacker intercepts the telemetry data sent to Azure Application Insights, leading to unauthorized access to operational data
When the attacker attempts to access the telemetry data
Then the system should detect and block the unauthorized access
And the system should log the attempt to access the telemetry data
```

### Test Case 13: Denial of Service - HTTP Endpoints
```gherkin
Given an attacker floods the HTTP endpoints of M1, M2, and M3 with excessive requests, leading to a denial of service
When the attacker floods the HTTP endpoints with excessive requests
Then the system should detect and mitigate the denial of service attack
And the system should log the attempt to flood the HTTP endpoints
```

### Test Case 14: Denial of Service - Azure Cognitive Service
```gherkin
Given an attacker floods the Azure Cognitive Service with excessive requests, leading to a denial of service
When the attacker floods the Azure Cognitive Service with excessive requests
Then the system should detect and mitigate the denial of service attack
And the system should log the attempt to flood the Azure Cognitive Service
```

### Test Case 15: Denial of Service - Azure Storage
```gherkin
Given an attacker floods the Azure Storage with excessive upload requests, leading to a denial of service
When the attacker floods the Azure Storage with excessive upload requests
Then the system should detect and mitigate the denial of service attack
And the system should log the attempt to flood the Azure Storage
```

### Test Case 16: Elevation of Privilege - IoT Edge Device
```gherkin
Given an attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the IoT Edge Device to gain elevated privileges, leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data and control over the device
When the attacker attempts to gain elevated privileges on the IoT Edge Device
Then the system should detect and block the attempt to gain elevated privileges
And the system should log the attempt to gain elevated privileges
```

### Test Case 17: Elevation of Privilege - Azure Services
```gherkin
Given an attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the Azure services to gain elevated privileges, leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data and control over the services
