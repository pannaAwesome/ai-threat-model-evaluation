The web application is build in three tiers: Web UI, Web Service and PostgreSQL.

PostgreSQL is in the trust zone Public Cloud and it is a data store that holds customer data. It is PostgreSQL database 
deployed on public cloud with Amazon Web Services, specifically Relational Database Service (RDS). The data is encrypted 
during transfer with HTTPS and SSL/TLS, and the encryption is applied at transport level so covering the whole connection.

Web Service is in the trust zone Public Cloud and it processes customer data, which can contain personally identifiable
information. This information is both send and received for the process. The Web Service uses a Java Web Container,
running on Amazon Web Services specifically Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). The Web Service implements an authentication function 
with a username and password login structure. The Web Service uses session management and it gives a unique session ID
which will be transmitted between the client and server. The data between the Web Service and the client is encrypted 
with HTTPS and SSL/TLS at the transport level. The Web Service can take XML as input from the client.

Web UI is in the internet trust zone and it sends and receives customer data, which can contain personally identifiable
information. The Web UI will request the user for a password based login before they can use the application. The data 
between the Web UI and the client is encrypted with HTTPS and SSL/TLS at the transport level. The Web UI is written
with JQuery.

The system has two processes: Web UI and Web Service, and one data store: PostgreSQL. Web UI is in the Internet trust
zone, and the Web Service and PostgreSQL is in the Public Cloud trust zone.
The Web UI exchanges requests and responses with the Web Service.
The Web Service exchanges queries and data with the PostgreSQL.

We have allowed that the PostgreSQL stores sensitive data, and this should not be factored into the threat model.
