    You are an impartial judge evaluating whether the following two threats describe the same issue.

    Criteria:
    - The `Category` must be the same.
    - If both threats specify an `Asset`, they must match. If not, infer the asset from the `Threat` field (usually the target or entry point and capitalized).
    - The `Threat` descriptions must have the same malicious objective and impact, either stated or implied.
    - Ignore differences in style, grammar, or formatting.

    Here are examples of similar threats:

    Example 1:
    Threat A:
    {{
