Rate limiting is crucial for controlling the frequency of client requests to prevent overuse and ensure fair resource allocation among users. Without proper rate-limiting controls, attackers can inundate the service with a high volume of requests, potentially leading to denial of service, resource exhaustion, and performance degradation. This vulnerability can also be exploited to facilitate other attack types, such as brute force attacks aimed at guessing user credentials.</p>
<p><strong>Threat Agents/Attack Vectors</strong></p> <p>The primary threat agents in this scenario are malicious actors or bots designed to exploit weaknesses in web services. Attack vectors include automated scripts or botnets that send a large number of requests in a short period, overwhelming the service. These actors may seek to disrupt the service availability, gain unauthorized access, or exploit the service for other malicious purposes. The lack of rate limiting makes it easier for such actors to carry out their attacks without being detected or throttled by the system.</p>
<p><strong>Impacts</strong></p> <p>The impacts of failing to implement adequate rate limiting can be severe. It can lead to service degradation, where legitimate users experience slow response times or are unable to access the service altogether. In extreme cases, it can result in a complete denial of service, making the web service unavailable. Furthermore, it can compromise the security of the service by facilitating brute force and other exploitation techniques, potentially leading to unauthorized access and data breaches.</p>
<p><strong>Example Attack Scenarios</strong></p> <p>An attacker deploys a botnet to send thousands of login requests per minute to a web service that lacks proper rate limiting. The service becomes overwhelmed with the volume of requests, leading to resource exhaustion and significant performance degradation. Legitimate users are unable to access the service, and the attacker may eventually bypass authentication controls through brute force attacks, gaining unauthorized access to sensitive information.</p> ",Expose,51,51,51,0,0,

Such vulnerabilities occur when the web service is not correctly secured, potentially due to oversight, lack of awareness, or misinterpretation of configuration settings. These vulnerabilities can allow attackers to access confidential information that should otherwise be protected, compromising the security and integrity of the web service and its users.</p>
<p><strong>Threat Agents/Attack Vectors</strong></p> <p>Threat agents in these scenarios can range from opportunistic hackers to sophisticated cybercriminals actively scanning for exposed information due to misconfigurations or errors. Attack vectors include exploiting publicly accessible directories, unprotected files, verbose error messages, and logs that contain sensitive information. Attackers may also use automated tools to scan for common misconfigurations or coding errors that lead to information exposure.</p>
<p><strong>Impacts</strong></p> <p>The exposure of sensitive information through misconfiguration, coding errors, or insecure logging can have severe consequences, including data breaches, identity theft, and unauthorized access to protected resources. It can also lead to loss of customer trust, reputational damage, and potential legal and regulatory implications for the organization. The compromised information can further be used in more sophisticated attacks, amplifying the overall risk to the organization and its stakeholders.</p>
<p><strong>Example Attack Scenarios</strong></p> <p>An attacker discovers that a web service's error messages are verbose and include detailed stack traces, revealing database connection strings and API keys. Utilizing this information, the attacker gains unauthorized access to the database and third-party services. In another scenario, an attacker finds a misconfigured server that logs all HTTP requests, including URLs containing unencrypted passwords and tokens.

Authentication bypass occurs when attackers find ways to circumvent authentication processes, allowing them to impersonate legitimate users or access the service without authorization. This threat can arise from various vulnerabilities, including inadequate access controls, the use of weak or default credentials, insecure session management, and other software flaws that may be exploited through injection attacks or other techniques.</p>
<p><strong>Threat Agents/Attack Vectors</strong></p> <p>The threat agents in this scenario include cybercriminals, malicious insiders, or automated bots that specifically target authentication mechanisms to gain unauthorized access. These agents might use various attack vectors, such as phishing to steal credentials, exploiting known vulnerabilities in authentication mechanisms, session hijacking, or even using previously leaked credentials obtained from other breaches (credential stuffing).</p>
<p><strong>Impacts</strong></p> <p>An authentication bypass can lead to severe impacts, including unauthorized access to sensitive data, data manipulation or theft, and potentially gaining elevated privileges within the system. Such incidents can result in financial loss, reputational damage, and legal consequences for the affected organization. Moreover, they compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the service, affecting both the service provider and its users.</p>
<p><strong>Example Attack Scenarios</strong></p> <p>An attacker discovers a vulnerability in the session management of a web service, allowing them to hijack an active session of a legitimate user. By exploiting this weakness, the attacker gains unauthorized access to the user's account without needing to bypass the login credentials.

5a3cafd7-3aa9-4659-818d-deceadedfffa,T-WEB-UI-T2,Web UI,Spoofing,Attackers can deceive users into clicking on hidden elements,"<p>This threat involves manipulating the web user interface (UI) to deceive users into clicking on elements that are not what they appear to be. This form of attack, often referred to as ""clickjacking,"" uses various techniques to trick a user into clicking on a concealed or disguised element. These elements, when clicked, can trigger unauthorized actions, such as liking a page, sharing sensitive information, or granting permissions to access data or perform actions on the user's behalf. The attack leverages the trust a user has in the visible UI, exploiting it to facilitate actions unintended by the user and unauthorized by the system.</p>
<p><strong>Threat Agents/Attack Vectors</strong></p>
<ul>
 <li><strong>Threat Agents:</strong> The primary agents behind these attacks are often cybercriminals aiming to exploit user trust for malicious purposes, ranging from spreading malware to executing phishing campaigns or stealing credentials.</li>
 <li><strong>Attack Vectors:</strong> Common vectors include: 
  <ul>
   <li><strong>UI Redressing:</strong> Overlaying transparent or cleverly disguised iframes over seemingly benign web pages.</li>
   <li><strong>Click Transparent Layer:</strong> Placing a transparent layer over a web page so that clicks intended for visible elements beneath are hijacked.</li>
   <li><strong>Cursor Hijacking:</strong> Altering the appearance or behavior of the cursor to deceive users about the actual point of click.</li>
  </ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Impacts</strong></p>
<p>The impacts of deceiving users into clicking on hidden elements can be widespread, affecting both individual users and organizations, including:</p>
<ul>
 <li><strong>Privacy Violations:</strong> Unauthorized sharing of personal or sensitive information without the user's knowledge.</li>
 <li><strong>Account Compromise:</strong> Unintentional granting of access or permissions to attackers, leading to account takeover or data breaches.</li>
 <li><strong>Malware Infection:</strong> Users might inadvertently download and install malware, leading to further exploitation.</li>
 <li><strong>Reputational Damage:</strong> Organizations may suffer reputational damage due to the exploitation of their platforms for such attacks.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example Attack Scenarios</strong></p>
<ul>
 <li><strong>Scenario 1:</strong> A user visits a seemingly harmless website that has been compromised with a clickjacking script. The script overlays a transparent iframe over a ""Play"" button for a video. Instead of playing the video, clicking the button unknowingly shares a malicious link on the user's social media profile.</li>
 <li><strong>Scenario 2:</strong> An attacker designs a webpage that mimics a popular game. However, hidden within the game's UI is a disguised button that, when clicked, triggers the download of a piece of malware. The malware is executed unwittingly by the user, compromising their system.</li>
 <li><strong>Scenario 3:</strong> On a compromised e-commerce site, attackers overlay a transparent layer over the entire webpage. When users attempt to click on legitimate items, they instead click on this invisible layer, which redirects them to a phishing site designed to steal their credentials.</li>
</ul>
<p>To mitigate these threats, developers can employ various strategies, such as implementing frame-busting scripts, enabling Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to prevent unauthorized framing, and educating users about the risks of clickjacking and similar deceptive practices. Additionally, regular security assessments of web applications can help identify and rectify vulnerabilities that could be exploited in such attacks.</p>",Expose,56,56,56,0,0,
53d21eb8-478b-4436-9ca1-b497eecdc24c,T-WEB-UI-T3,Web UI,Tampering,Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies leading to security breaches,"<p>The exploitation of vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies is a significant threat in software development, particularly in web UI components that rely heavily on external libraries and frameworks. These dependencies can include everything from frontend libraries for UI elements to backend frameworks for data processing. If any of these third-party components are found to have security vulnerabilities, attackers can exploit them to compromise the security of the entire application. This can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and a range of other security incidents. The challenge is exacerbated by the complex dependency trees common in modern web development, where a single project might include hundreds of nested third-party dependencies.</p>
<p><strong>Threat Agents/Attack Vectors</strong></p>
<ul>
 <li><strong>Threat Agents:</strong> Both opportunistic hackers and targeted attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies. They might scan a wide range of websites and applications for known vulnerabilities or target specific high-value applications using intelligence gathered about the software stack they rely on.</li>
 <li><strong>Attack Vectors:</strong> Common vectors include: 
  <ul>
   <li><strong>Exploiting Known Vulnerabilities:</strong> Using known vulnerabilities in public databases like CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) to attack widely used dependencies.</li>
   <li><strong>Supply Chain Attacks:</strong> Compromising a third-party library or tool directly to inject malicious code, affecting all downstream applications that use that dependency.</li>
   <li><strong>Dependency Confusion:</strong> Trick developers into downloading and using malicious versions of dependencies that mimic legitimate packages.</li>
  </ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Impacts</strong></p>
<p>The exploitation of vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies can have a range of impacts, including:</p>
<ul>
 <li><strong>Data Breach:</strong> Unauthorized access to sensitive personal and business data, potentially leading to financial loss and damage to reputation.</li>
 <li><strong>System Compromise:</strong> Full or partial control over the application or underlying systems, allowing for further attacks or persistent access.</li>
 <li><strong>Denial of Service (DoS):</strong> Disabling the application or making it unavailable to legitimate users, possibly as a smokescreen for other malicious activities.</li>
 <li><strong>Compliance Violations:</strong> Breaches may result in violations of regulatory requirements, leading to fines and legal action.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example Attack Scenarios</strong></p>
<ul>
 <li><strong>Scenario 1:</strong> An attacker discovers that a popular web UI framework has a known cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. They craft a payload that, when executed, steals session cookies from users of all websites that use the vulnerable version of the framework.</li>
 <li><strong>Scenario 2:</strong> A widely used open-source logging library is found to have a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability. Before the vulnerability is widely known and patched, attackers exploit it to execute arbitrary code on servers running the vulnerable library, leading to data breaches at multiple organizations.</li>
 <li><strong>Scenario 3:</strong> Through a sophisticated supply chain attack, malicious code is inserted into a minor update of a common dependency used by e-commerce platforms. This code silently exfiltrates credit card information entered by shoppers on sites using the compromised version of the dependency.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mitigating these threats involves implementing a robust security process for managing third-party dependencies. This includes regularly auditing and updating dependencies, using automated tools to identify known vulnerabilities, employing software composition analysis (SCA) tools, and adopting a secure software development lifecycle (SDLC) that incorporates security considerations from the initial design phase through to deployment and beyond. Additionally, developers should be wary of adding unnecessary dependencies to projects and consider the security posture of any third-party code they incorporate into their applications.</p>",Expose,56,56,56,0,0,

XSS attacks involve the insertion of malicious scripts into the output of a web application, which are then executed in the browser of the user viewing the web page. These attacks exploit vulnerabilities in web applications that fail to adequately sanitize user input or content that is displayed to users. The consequences of XSS attacks can range from minor nuisances to significant security breaches, including theft of session tokens, cookies, personal data, and even the delivery of malware.</p>
<p><strong>Threat Agents/Attack Vectors</strong></p>
<ul>
 <li><strong>Threat Agents:</strong> XSS attacks can be launched by anyone with basic knowledge of HTML and JavaScript, ranging from individual hobbyist hackers to sophisticated cybercriminal groups. The goal might be to target a specific user, a particular organization, or any users of a vulnerable web application.</li>
 <li><strong>Attack Vectors:</strong> There are several vectors through which XSS attacks can be carried out: 
  <ul>
   <li><strong>Stored XSS:</strong> Malicious scripts are permanently stored on the target server (e.g., in a database, message forum, visitor log, or comment field), and the script is executed whenever the compromised data is viewed.</li>
   <li><strong>Reflected XSS:</strong> The malicious script is part of the request sent to the web server, which is then reflected back in such a way that the web server sends the script to the user’s browser, where it is executed.</li>
   <li><strong>DOM-based XSS:</strong> The vulnerability exists in the client-side code rather than the server-side code. The attacker manipulates the Document Object Model (DOM) of the web page and injects a script that is executed by the user’s browser.</li>
  </ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Impacts</strong></p>
<p>The impacts of XSS attacks can be significant, including:</p>
<ul>
 <li><strong>Session Hijacking:</strong> Stealing or manipulating cookies to impersonate the victim.</li>
 <li><strong>Phishing:</strong> Displaying fake login prompts to steal usernames and passwords.</li>
 <li><strong>Malware Distribution:</strong> Spreading malware by including malicious scripts on web pages.</li>
 <li><strong>Credential Theft:</strong> Capturing keystrokes or form input to steal user credentials.</li>
 <li><strong>Defacement:</strong> Altering the appearance of the web page to spread misinformation or harm the organization's reputation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example Attack Scenarios</strong></p>
<ul>
 <li><strong>Scenario 1:</strong> An attacker discovers a vulnerability in a web application’s comment section that does not sanitize user input. They submit a comment containing a malicious script. When other users view the comment, the script executes, stealing their session cookies and sending them to the attacker.</li>
 <li><strong>Scenario 2:</strong> A user receives an email with a link to a seemingly legitimate website but is actually a malicious URL containing a script. Clicking the link sends the user to the vulnerable website, where the script runs in their browser, displaying a fake login page that captures the user's credentials when entered.</li>
 <li><strong>Scenario 3:</strong> An attacker injects a script into a poorly secured web application that rewrites the DOM to include a hidden iframe. This iframe then loads a phishing site or malware, compromising the user’s system or stealing sensitive information.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mitigation strategies against XSS include implementing robust input validation and output encoding to ensure that user-supplied data is sanitized before being returned to the user. Content Security Policy (CSP) can also be utilized to reduce the risk of XSS by specifying legitimate sources of executable scripts and effectively limiting where resources can be loaded from. Regular security testing, including automated scanning and manual code review, is crucial to identifying and fixing XSS vulnerabilities before attackers can exploit them.</p>",Expose,68,68,68,0,0,

This vulnerability is often rooted in design faults within the application or service-level serialization logic. Attackers exploit these flaws by sending crafted data that, once deserialized, executes malicious code within the service's environment. Such vulnerabilities are especially critical in web services that rely heavily on serialization to process complex data structures received from clients, making them susceptible to attacks aiming to disrupt or gain unauthorized control over the service.</p>
<p><strong>Threat Agents/Attack Vectors</strong></p> <p>The primary threat agents exploiting deserialization flaws include external attackers and, in some cases, malicious insiders. These individuals craft and submit data that, when deserialized by the vulnerable service, leads to the execution of malicious code. Attack vectors can involve submitting crafted objects via web forms, API calls, or any other input mechanisms accepted by the web service. Exploits can be designed to target specific vulnerabilities in the service's deserialization logic, leveraging the application's own functionality to trigger malicious outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>Impacts</strong></p> <p>The impacts of exploiting deserialization flaws can be severe and varied, ranging from unauthorized access and data exfiltration to denial-of-service attacks and the complete compromise of the underlying server. Such attacks can lead to the theft of sensitive information, execution of arbitrary code with server privileges, disruption of service availability, and potential escalation to further attacks on the network or other connected systems.

970fb22f-9b87-40cb-a8f6-910ce42417d4,T-WEB-UI-T1,Web UI,Elevation of Privilege,Attackers may exploit weaknesses in authentication and authorization mechanisms,"<p>Weaknesses in authentication and authorization mechanisms represent significant security vulnerabilities within web-based user interfaces. These weaknesses can allow unauthorized access to sensitive information and systems. Authentication weaknesses pertain to flaws in verifying the identity of users attempting to access a service. Authorization weaknesses involve inadequacies in controlling what authenticated users are allowed to do. Together, these vulnerabilities can be exploited to gain unauthorized access or escalate privileges within a system.</p>
<p><strong>Threat Agents/Attack Vectors</strong></p>
<ul>
 <li><strong>Threat Agents:</strong> The agents can range from automated scripts (bots) scanning the internet for vulnerabilities to exploit, to malicious insiders with legitimate access trying to elevate their privileges. External attackers, including cybercriminals and state-sponsored actors, may also exploit these weaknesses for various purposes.</li>
 <li><strong>Attack Vectors:</strong> Common attack vectors include credential stuffing, where attackers use previously breached username and password pairs to gain unauthorized access; phishing attacks aimed at tricking users into disclosing their credentials; and exploitation of implementation flaws in authentication mechanisms (e.g., bypassing multi-factor authentication) or authorization schemes (e.g., exploiting insecure direct object references to access unauthorized resources).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Impacts</strong></p>
<p>The exploitation of weaknesses in authentication and authorization mechanisms can lead to several adverse impacts, including:</p>
<ul>
 <li><strong>Data Breach:</strong> Unauthorized access to sensitive personal or business data, leading to loss of confidentiality.</li>
 <li><strong>Privilege Escalation:</strong> Attackers gaining higher-level access than what is authorized, potentially leading to full system compromise.</li>
 <li><strong>Reputation Damage:</strong> The loss of customer trust and damage to the organization's reputation following a security breach.</li>
 <li><strong>Financial Loss:</strong> Direct financial loss from theft or fraud, and indirect costs associated with incident response, legal fees, and potential fines for regulatory non-compliance.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example Attack Scenarios</strong></p>
<ul>
 <li><strong>Scenario 1:</strong> An attacker discovers a web application does not properly enforce password complexity requirements. They use a brute-force attack to guess weak passwords and gain unauthorized access to multiple user accounts.</li>
 <li><strong>Scenario 2:</strong> A web application uses predictable resource IDs for user profiles. An authenticated attacker modifies the URL to an ID they do not own, directly accessing and altering another user’s profile due to improper authorization checks.</li>
 <li><strong>Scenario 3:</strong> An attacker performs a phishing campaign, sending emails to users of a web application, tricking them into clicking a link that leads to a fake login page designed to steal their credentials. Once successful, the attacker uses these credentials to gain unauthorized access to the web application.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mitigating these threats requires implementing robust authentication mechanisms, such as multi-factor authentication, enforcing strong password policies, and regularly auditing and updating authorization logic to ensure that users can only access resources appropriate for their privilege level. Regular security assessments and awareness training for users can also significantly reduce the risk of such attacks.</p>",Expose,56,56,56,0,0,

907dd168-07c6-4136-9349-bcd4d096396a,T-MITM,Web Service,Tampering,Attackers use Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) to intercept communications,"<p><strong>General Threat Description</strong></p> <p>Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks pose a substantial threat to server-side web services, such as REST APIs or gRPC services. In this type of attack, an unauthorized actor intercepts, and potentially alters, the communications between two parties who believe they are directly communicating with each other. The attacker's ability to secretly listen in on or manipulate the data being exchanged makes MitM attacks particularly insidious. These attacks can occur at any stage of the data transmission process, exploiting vulnerabilities in the network or the encryption protocols used to secure the communication.</p>
<p><strong>Threat Agents/Attack Vectors</strong></p> <p>Threat agents carrying out MitM attacks can range from individual hackers to organized cybercriminal groups. These attackers exploit weaknesses in network security, deploy malicious software, or utilize compromised network devices to intercept communications. Techniques include network eavesdropping, DNS hijacking, ARP spoofing, and exploiting weak encryption protocols. In cases where communications are encrypted, attackers may employ SSL stripping to force a connection to revert to an unencrypted state, or use forged certificates to decrypt and access the data without raising suspicion.</p>
<p><strong>Impacts</strong></p> <p>The impacts of MitM attacks can be severe, ranging from the breach of sensitive information, such as personal data and login credentials, to the manipulation of data in transit. This can lead to financial fraud, identity theft, unauthorized transactions, and the spread of malware. Additionally, the compromise of communication integrity and confidentiality can erode trust in the web service, resulting in reputational damage and potential legal implications for the service provider.</p>
<p><strong>Example Attack Scenarios</strong></p> <p>An attacker conducts a DNS hijacking attack to intercept communications between users and a financial service's REST API. The attacker redirects users to a fraudulent version of the service, where login credentials are harvested. In another scenario, through ARP spoofing, an attacker intercepts and modifies the transaction details sent from a client to a web service, altering the payee information and redirecting funds to an account under the attacker's control.</p> ",Expose,88,88,88,0,0,
