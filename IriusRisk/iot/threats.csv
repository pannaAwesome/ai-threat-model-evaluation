The threat of data loss and downtime due to operational failure or security breaches is a concern with stateful applications, even if backup and recovery mechanisms are in place.

<br><strong>Threat agents/Attack vectors</strong><br>
Threat agents include malicious actors seeking to disrupt or compromise the application and its data. Attack vectors may include unauthorized access to the application and its storage, injection of malicious code, or intentional deletion or corruption of data.

<br><strong>Impacts</strong><br>
The impacts of a successful attack or operational failure could include loss of data, extended downtime, potential regulatory non-compliance, and damage to the organization's reputation and trust.

<br><strong>Example Attack Scenarios</strong><br>
1. An attacker gains unauthorized access to the application and its backup data, leading to the theft or deletion of critical information.
2. Malicious code injection results in the corruption or encryption of application data, rendering backups unusable for recovery.
3. Operational failure, such as misconfiguration or human error, causes accidental deletion or overwriting of critical data, leading to service disruption.",Expose,88,88,88,0,0,
